# Accuracy Experiments
This repository contains procedures to **reproduce the accuracy experiments** presented in the paper  
**SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing: Accurate Intersection Point Calculation**.

All required commands are stored in `./accuracy_experiments/run_accuracy_benchmark.sh`. Since the project relies on `mppp` support, it is recommended to use `GCC 13` for building.


> **Note:** All commands should be executed within the `./accuracy_experiments` directory.  
> Before proceeding, navigate to the correct directory using:
```bash
cd ./accuracy_experiments
```


## Cmake build
To build the project using `CMake` and `ninja`, run the following command
```bash
BUILD_DIR="build_gcc13"
SRC_DIR="<source_directory>"


Clean up the old build directory if it exists
if [ -d "$BUILD_DIR" ]; then
  echo "Removing old build directory: $BUILD_DIR"
  rm -rf "$BUILD_DIR"
fi

# Create the new build directory
echo "Creating build directory: $BUILD_DIR"
mkdir "$BUILD_DIR"
cd "$BUILD_DIR" || exit 1

echo "Configuring the project with CMake..."
cmake -GNinja \
      -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc-13 \
      -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++-13 \
      -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
      -DCGAL_DIR=/home/jpanetta/software/CGAL-6.0 \
      "$SRC_DIR"
ninja


```

## Generate Data Set
Use the following command to generate both the primary and secondary datasets, if needed. The generated data will be stored in `./accuracy_experiments/generated_arcs`, with each floating-point result represented as a pair of significand and exponent values.  

In the script below, `LATITUDES` defines the latitude intervals for generating the primary dataset, while `"$OFFSETS"` specifies the offset intervals for the secondary experiments

It's highly recommanded to run `./sanitize_arcs` for the newly-generated arcs before running the experiments.

```bash
# Specify the number of arcs you want to generate
NUM_ARCS="100000"


# Generate the preferred lattitude interval
LATITUDES="0,0.000001,0.00001,0.0001,0.001,0.01,0.1,1,10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,89,89.9"


# Generate 5 points between each specified range around pole area
LATITUDES+=$(echo ",89.99,$(seq -f '%.6f' 89.99 0.0002 89.999 | tail -n +2 | head -n 4 | tr '\n' ',' | sed 's/,$//')")
LATITUDES+=$(echo ",89.999,$(seq -f '%.7f' 89.999 0.00004 89.9999 | tail -n +2 | head -n 4 | tr '\n' ',' | sed 's/,$//')")
LATITUDES+=$(echo ",89.9999,$(seq -f '%.8f' 89.9999 0.000008 89.99999 | tail -n +2 | head -n 4 | tr '\n' ',' | sed 's/,$//')")
LATITUDES+=",89.99999,90"

# Initialize the OFFSETS
OFFSETS="0.01"

# Generate decreasing values from 0.01 to 0.0000001 (1e-15), dividing by 10 at each step
value=0.01
while (( $(awk "BEGIN {print ($value >= 0.00000000000001)}") )); do
    value=$(awk "BEGIN {print ($value / 10)}")
    OFFSETS+=",$(printf "%.16f" $value)"  # Format value to 8 decimal places
done


Optionally run the generate_arcs and sanitize_arcs  executables 
./generate_arcs "$NUM_ARCS" "$LATITUDES" "$OFFSETS"
echo "generate_arcs has been executed."

./sanitize_arcs "$MPFR_PRECISIONS" "$LATITUDES" "$OFFSETS"
echo "sanitize_arcs has been executed."

```


### Run the benchmark
Below will generate the benchmark for both primary and secondary datasets that's being stored in the directory `./accuracy_experiments/benchmark_results` and also the intermediate results will also be stored in `./accuracy_experiments/intermediate_results`. each flaoting point number results will be store as a pair of significant and exponent.

```bash
# The selected MPFR precisions,
MPFR_PRECISIONS="16,17,18,19,20,22,24,26,28,30,32"

# Run all method benchmark except for CGAL
./run_benchmarks "$MPFR_PRECISIONS" "$LATITUDES"
echo "run_benchmarks has been executed."

# Run CGAL benchmark
./CGAL_accuracy "$LATITUDES"
echo "Complete running of CGAL_accuracy"

./intermediate_results "$MPFR_PRECISIONS" "$LATITUDES"
echo "intermediate_results has been executed."
```

### Run Analysis 
Now utilizing the Wolframe mathematica to read the benchmark result and perform the analysis, the results will be stored in `./accuracy_experiments/mathematica_data`

```bash
# Now run the mathematica script
WOLFRAMSCRIPT_PATH="<Your WOLFRAMSCRIPT Path>"

# Run AccuracyAnalysis.m
"$WOLFRAMSCRIPT_PATH" -file "$SRC_DIR/AccuracyAnalysis.m" -- "$MPFR_PRECISIONS" "$LATITUDES"
echo "AccuracyAnalysis.m has been executed."

"$WOLFRAMSCRIPT_PATH" -file "$SRC_DIR/AccuracyAnalysisArcUp.m" -- "$MPFR_PRECISIONS" "$OFFSETS"
echo "AccuracyAnalysisArcUp.m has been executed."

"$WOLFRAMSCRIPT_PATH" -file "$SRC_DIR/AccuracyAnalysisArcUpCGAL.m" -- "$MPFR_PRECISIONS" "$OFFSETS"
echo "AccuracyAnalysisArcUpCGAL.m has been executed."


# # Define query ranges
QUERY_RANGE="{0,1},{2,89},{89,90}"
QUERY_RANGE_ENTIRE_NORTH="{0,90}"
# Run IntermediateAnalysis.m for the entire globe
"$WOLFRAMSCRIPT_PATH" -file "$SRC_DIR/IntermediateAnalysis.m" -- "$MPFR_PRECISIONS" "$LATITUDES" "$QUERY_RANGE_ENTIRE_NORTH"
echo "IntermediateAnalysis.m for entire globe has been executed."
```

### Krumm's Implementation
Krumm's method is implemented in Python and analyzed separately from other methods.
The implementation files are:

- `./accuracy_experiments/gcsxsc.py`
- `./accuracy_experiments/geometries.py`
- `./accuracy_experiments/utils.py`

To run the Krummâ€™s method, execute:

```bash
python3 ./accuracy_experiments/gcsxsc.py
```

Ensure that the variable **`base_path`** in the `main` function points to the correct directories.

For analysis, use the `./accuracy_experiments/krumm_accuracy.nb` notebook. Update the following inputs:

1. **For primary dataset:**
```mathematica
arcFilename = latRangeStr <> "Arcs_Exponent.csv";
benchmarkKrummFilename = latRangeStr <> "_krumm_double_ArcUp.csv";
```
2. **For secondary dataset:**
```mathematica
arcFilename = latRangeStr <> "ArcUp_Arcs_Exponent.csv";
benchmarkKrummFilename = latRangeStr <> "_krumm_double_ArcUp.csv";
```

Refer to the naming convention in `./generated_arcs` and `./benchmark_results` directories to ensure correctness.
